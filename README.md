# spaceflow
A emulation\simulation framework of space network
![](./fig/framework.png)

This simu/emulation framework contains three parts:
- [scenario](https://github.com/xdr940/scenario)
- mininet-space 
- [visualizer](https://github.com/xdr940/visualizer)

*scenario* is used to build the simulation scenario of space network and generate the CZML file required by the *visualizer*.

*mininet-space*  is a network emulator, which is based on mininet and still under development. It is temporarily embedded in the whole framework with the [visualizer-backend](https://github.com/xdr940/visualizer-backend) as a substitute to achieve basic operation.

*visualizer* is a visualization tool, not only to visualize the scene generated by the *scenario*, but also to connect to the *mininet-space(visualizer-backend)*, to visualize the network process.
